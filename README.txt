Things that work:
-Everything up to going into the first ELSE statement works so far, in terms of me testing the program. Ready to do further tests..



Problems:
-Couldn't fit 0XFFFF into memory variables so changed it to 16384 instead ( for a random reason, saw this value somewhere and tried it)
-Commenting out program block by block to see where program is going wrong
-Perhaps indexing the memory wrong when transferring from cache to memory and vice versa. Do we index with tag? Or do we index with tag and index?
